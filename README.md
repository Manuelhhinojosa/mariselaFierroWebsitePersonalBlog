# 📝 Marisela Fierro Blog & website

This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application built as a personal blog and portfolio site for a real client — artist and academic Marisela Fierro.

## 📝 About the Project

This is the client-side of the blog platform. It includes:
Full CRUD functionality: the admin (client) can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Authentication: secure login for a single admin user, as requested by the client.
Dynamic project showcase: a portfolio section that fetches and displays project data.
Responsive design that adapts to different devices.
UI/UX layout is entirely designed by the client — no visual changes were made unless requested.
This project was built with care and attention to detail, and it marks my first full freelance project for a real client.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

React.js (with React Router v6)
Node.js + Express.js
MongoDB with Mongoose

🔒 API and Backend

The backend API was fully built by me as well, including authentication, post routing, and error handling.

## 💼 Real Client Collaboration

This site was made in collaboration with a real client who provided the visual design and content requirements. All functionality was tailored specifically to their needs — including the blog flow, login permissions, and layout preferences.
