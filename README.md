# Marisela Blog App (client side)

Welcome to the Marisela Blog App (Client side). This application was developed as my first freelance project for a real client. It showcases my ability to build full-stack applications utilizing the MERN stack to deliver a complete solution with a simple, user-friendly interface. I also built the accompanying API, ensuring smooth functionality and efficient data handling, allowing for a single user (Admin) to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, with a clean and simple interface to manage content.

### Description

This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is designed to be a fully functional blog where a single user (admin) can log in, manage posts, and interact with the backend API to perform CRUD operations. The app also integrates Toastify notifications for smooth user feedback during interactions.
The frontend communicates with the backend through Axios to perform actions on posts and authenticate users, such API developed 100% by me, you can check the repo here.
